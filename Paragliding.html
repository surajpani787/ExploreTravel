        <strong>Paragliding...</strong>
    </h1>
    <div class="container">
        <p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/parachute" class="md-crosslink">parachutes</a>, sport of
            flying parachutes with design modifications that enhance their <a
                href="https://www.britannica.com/sports/gliding-sport" class="md-crosslink">gliding</a> capabilities.
            Unlike <a href="https://www.britannica.com/sports/hang-gliding" class="md-crosslink">hang gliders</a>, their
            close relations, paragliders have no rigid framework; the <a
                href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/parachute" class="md-crosslink autoxref">parachute</a>
            canopy acts
            as a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/wing-aircraft" class="md-crosslink">wing</a> and is
            constructed of fabric cells with openings at the front that allow them to be inflated by
            movement through the air—the “ram-air” effect.</p>

        <p>The pilot is suspended in a seated harness and controls the wing via lines attached to the trailing edge of
            the paraglider. These lines may be operated individually to turn the paraglider or simultaneously to
            influence pitch and speed. Takeoff and landing are on foot and usually occur on a hill or mountain. To
            launch, the pilot first inflates the wing by pulling it up like a kite and then runs down the hillside until
            flying speed has been reached. Usually a speed of about 12 miles per hour (19 km per hour) is enough to
            launch the craft. Paragliders may also be launched from flatland by towing, either with a winch or behind a
            vehicle.</p>

        <p>The sport can be traced to the activities of French parachute inventor Pierre Lemoigne, who tow-launched his
            advanced round-parachute canopies in the 1950s. The ram-air-inflated cell structure originated in the early
            1960s with the kite and parachute designs of the Canadian-born American inventor Domina Jalbert. These
            designs evolved into steerable rectangular parachutes with relatively high forward speed. It was soon found
            that they had sufficient glide performance to allow them to be launched from steep slopes as well as by the
            aircraft deployment usual for parachutists.</p>

                Meghalaya is the perfect destination for an exhilarating joyride in the skies owing to its snow-clad
